# Service-Oriented Architecture
  ## Existing problem
  ### Issues with scalability
  #### Scalability refers to the performance of a software/application with the increase in user consumption. Issues with scalability can arise due to multiple reasons like monolithic architecture, database bottlenecks, the sudden increase in user base, etc.. 
  ### Issues with performance
  #### Issues with performance can usually result in slow responses. It can mostly happen due to network latency, using outdated/inefficient algorithms, etc..
  ## What is SOA
   1. SOA stands for Service-Oriented Architecture.
   2. It usually is an architectural approach in which developers make use of different services available in the network by using interfaces.
   3. It will make code reusable and easy to understand.
   4. Key advantages of using SOA architecture include scalability, loose coupling, flexibility, and adaptability. 
  ## How can we use SOA to minimize our existing problems
  * our existing problems are scalability and performance-related issues which can be mostly solved by using SOA architecture.
  * SOA architecture uses separate services available to complete a particular task and integrate them into our code which will help a lot with scalability.
  * Monolithic architecture has all the components written in a single module and can delay the responses or may not even give a response if anything goes wrong in between.
  * With the use of SOA architecture, we can write different modules for different tasks and can integrate them all using interfaces.
## Implementation
1. Identification of discrete business services.
2. Design each service with valid inputs and outputs.
3. Take it slow.. Follow gradual integration.
## Challenges with the implementation of SOA and Overcoming them
* Changing the architecture to SOA can be challenging, especially with the integration of components and all.
* We can avoid these challenges by gradually introducing SOA by writing separate units and integrating them after complete testing.
## Disadvantages
* Initial investment
* Complex Service Management
## conclusion:
* Adoption of SOA architecture to solve scalability and performance issues can be a great idea.
* Though there is a high investment initially, the code will be scalable, maintainable, and can easily avoid performance bottlenecks.
* By following the steps provided in implementation we can overcome most of the challenges that we may face during the architectural shift.
* We will need further collaboration with the team for successful implementation and for the consideration of corner cases if any.!
